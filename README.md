This is a voice assistant like Jarvis in MCU. For this code to work, after running the code you have to say commands like "What is your name?" or "How old are you?" or "Open Youtube",
like the commands given in the code. Then it will reply its name as a voice assistant would or would open youtube or what your command was. But it will only work if you are in a quiet
place, so that it won't disturb the voice commands and only if you give the commands given in the code. If you wish for it to work the way you want it to, then you might try to modify 
the code a bit and give your own commands as you see fit and it will work as it should.
